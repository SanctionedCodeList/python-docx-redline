## High-Alert Vocabulary

These words have seen dramatic usage increases since 2022 and are now associated with AI writing. One or two may be coincidental; clusters are red flags.

### Tier 1: Immediate Red Flags

| Word | Why It's Flagged | Alternative |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| **delve** | Most notorious AI tell; usage skyrocketed post-2022 | examine, explore, look at, investigate |
| **tapestry** | "No innocent use of 'tapestry' in an essay anymore" | combination, mix, array, collection |
| **multifaceted** | Pseudo-sophisticated filler | complex, varied, diverse |
| **pivotal** | Overused dramatic adjective | important, key, significant |
| **realm** | Semantically flexible, AI uses everywhere | area, field, domain, space |
| **landscape** | Generic metaphor applied to everything | environment, situation, context |

### Tier 2: Strong Indicators

| Word | Alternative |
|------|-------------|
| **nuanced** | subtle, detailed, careful |
| **intricate** | detailed, complex, elaborate |
| **meticulous/meticulously** | careful, thorough, detailed |
| **crucial/vital** | important, necessary, essential |
| **embark** | start, begin, launch |
| **showcasing** | showing, demonstrating, displaying |
| **underscores** | highlights, emphasizes, shows |
| **vibrant** | active, lively, dynamic |
| **comprehensive** | complete, thorough, full |
| **cutting-edge** | new, modern, advanced, latest |
| **revolutionary** | new, significant, major |
| **testament** | proof, evidence, example |

### Tier 3: Moderate Indicators (In Clusters)

| Category | Words |
|----------|-------|
| **Verbs** | foster, leverage, utilize, navigate, unpack, explore |
| **Adjectives** | robust, seamless, holistic, dynamic, innovative |
| **Nouns** | synergy, paradigm, framework, ecosystem |

### Evolving Patterns

AI vocabulary shifts over time:
- "Delve" usage is declining as it became notorious
- "Core" and "modern" are rising as new favorites
- Watch for new patterns in each model generation

---

## Structural Patterns

### The Negation Structure ("It's Not X, It's Y")

AI frequently uses contrastive structures that "set up and then negate or expand beyond expectations":

**Patterns to Avoid:**
- "X isn't just about Y"
- "X is more than just Y"
- "X goes beyond Y"
- "It's not merely X, it's Y"

**Example (Bad):**
> "The teams who will thrive now aren't just using AI for speed. They're combining it with judgment, experience, and original thinking."

**Example (Good):**
> "Thriving teams combine AI speed with human judgment and experience."

**Detection:** Search for the word "just" to identify obvious negation patterns.

### The Rule of Three (Triplets)

AI structures ideas in threes (tricolon) as a default rhetorical device:

**Examples (Obvious AI):**
- "I honed my skills in research, collaboration, and problem-solving"
- "My passion grew from curiosity to exploration to mastery"
- "This approach is efficient, effective, and economical"

**Fixes:**
- Remove one item from triplets
- Combine two items
- Add significantly more items
- Restructure as prose

### Formulaic Openings

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| "In today's ever-evolving world..." | [Delete entirely; start with your point] |
| "In the realm of..." | "In [topic]..." or just start with the topic |
| "When it comes to..." | [Delete; state the topic directly] |
| "It's important to note that..." | [Delete; just state the note] |
| "As we navigate the complexities of..." | [Delete entirely] |

### Formulaic Closings

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| "In conclusion..." | [Often unnecessary; delete] |
| "In summary..." | [Often unnecessary; delete] |
| "In essence..." | [Delete; restate key point if needed] |
| "Overall..." | [Delete or be specific] |
| "To sum up..." | [Delete; your conclusion should be clear] |

### Section-Ending Summaries

AI adds redundant summaries at the end of sections. In professional documents, sections should stand alone without restating what was just said.

**Bad:**
> [Three paragraphs about market analysis]
> "In summary, the market analysis shows strong growth potential with manageable risks."

**Good:**
> [Three paragraphs about market analysis]
> [Move directly to next section]

---

## Transition Word Overuse

AI overuses formal academic transitions that create choppy, predictable flow.

### High-Frequency AI Transitions

| Transition | Description | Alternative |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Moreover** | "Classic 'I'm not done lecturing you'" | Also, And, [new sentence] |
| **Furthermore** | Makes it "extra fancy" | Also, And, [restructure] |
| **Additionally** | "Because 'also' isn't good enough" | Also, And, [new sentence] |
| **Consequently** | Overly formal | So, As a result, Therefore |
| **Subsequently** | Stiff, academic | Then, Next, After that |
| **Nonetheless** | | Still, Yet, However |
| **Interestingly** | Superficial commentary marker | [Delete; let the content speak] |
| **Notably** | | [Delete or integrate naturally] |

### The Pattern

AI text often reads like:
> "The market grew 15%. Moreover, consumer spending increased. Furthermore, inventory levels stabilized. Additionally, margins improved."

Human text flows:
> "The market grew 15%, driven by increased consumer spending. Inventory levels stabilized, and margins improved."

### Fix Strategy

1. Delete unnecessary transitions
2. Combine short sentences
3. Use "and," "but," "so" instead of formal alternatives
4. Let paragraph breaks do the work of transitions

---

## Empty Significance Markers

AI inserts superficial analysis phrases that inflate importance without adding substance.

### Puffery Phrases

| Phrase | Problem |
|--------|---------|
| "stands as a testament to..." | Empty significance |
| "plays a vital/crucial/pivotal role" | Inflated importance |
| "underscores its importance" | Tell, don't underscore |
| "rich cultural heritage" | Cliche filler |
| "enduring legacy" | Vague significance |
| "significant impact on..." | Usually meaningless |
| "demonstrates the importance of..." | Show it instead |

### The "-ing" Clause Pattern

AI attaches present participle phrases to sentences to add superficial analysis:

**Bad:**
> "The company expanded into three new markets, underscoring its commitment to growth."

**Good:**
> "The company expanded into three new markets."

Or if commitment matters:
> "The company expanded into three new markets, part of a five-year growth initiative."

### Editorial Commentary

Phrases that introduce personal interpretation AI shouldn't have:

| Avoid | Action |
|-------|--------|
| "It's important to note that..." | Delete the phrase; keep the content |
| "It is worth mentioning..." | Delete the phrase |
| "No discussion would be complete without..." | Delete entirely |
| "One cannot overstate..." | Delete or quantify |
| "It goes without saying..." | Then don't say it |

---

## Tone and Style Issues

### Excessive Formality

AI defaults to formal register unless instructed otherwise:

| Overly Formal | Natural |
|---------------|---------|
| "utilize" | "use" |
| "facilitate" | "help" |
| "implement" | "do" or "start" |
| "endeavor" | "try" |
| "commence" | "begin" or "start" |
| "terminate" | "end" |
| "prior to" | "before" |
| "subsequent to" | "after" |

### Uniform Sentence Length

AI produces paragraphs with similar sentence lengths. Human writing varies:
- Short punchy sentences for emphasis
- Longer sentences for complex ideas
- Fragments for effect

### Excessive Positivity

AI avoids criticism and hedges everything:

**AI-Like:**
> "While there are some considerations to keep in mind, the overall approach demonstrates considerable promise."

**Direct:**
> "This approach has two significant problems: cost overruns and timeline delays."

### Perfect Grammar

Counterintuitively, perfect grammar can signal AI. Human text contains:
- Occasional sentence fragments for style
- Colloquialisms appropriate to context
- Minor imperfections that feel natural

---

## Punctuation Tells

### Em Dash Overuse

GPT-4 and later models use em dashes at 10x the rate of GPT-3.5. AI uses em dashes where humans would use:
- Commas
- Parentheses
- Colons

**AI Pattern:**
> "The project—which started in March—delivered results—significant results—by June."

**Human Pattern:**
> "The project, which started in March, delivered significant results by June."

### Em Dash Detection

Look for em dashes used:
- Multiple times per paragraph
- Where commas would work
- In formulaic, "punched up" sales-like ways

### Curly Quote Absence

AI (especially Claude and Gemini) often outputs straight quotes (" ") instead of curly quotes (" "). This is a minor tell but noticeable in professional documents.

## Model-Specific Patterns

### ChatGPT Tells

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **First words** | "As," "Yes," "Sure," "Here," "Certainly" |
| **Phrases** | "such as," "certainly," "overall," "utilize," "various," "typically" |
| **Formatting** | Heavy bold text, structured headings, extensive markdown |
| **Emojis** | 70% of messages contain emojis; especially checkmark and brain |

### Claude Tells

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **First words** | "In," "From," "This," "How," "Based" |
| **Phrases** | "according to," "based on," "the text," "while," "appears to" |
| **Style** | More measured/professional tone, minimal markdown |
| **Characteristics** | Lower detection rates; naturally academic tone |

### Conversational Artifacts

Obvious tells when AI forgets it's writing a document:

- "I hope this helps"
- "Certainly!"
- "Sure!"
- "Let me know if you have questions"
- "As an AI language model..."
- "As of my last training update..."
- "I'd be happy to..."

## Detection and Editing

### Manual Detection Strategy

1. **Scan for vocabulary clusters** - Three or more Tier 1/2 words in a page
2. **Check opening sentences** - Formulaic openers are immediate tells
3. **Look for triplets** - Rule of three patterns throughout
4. **Count em dashes** - More than 2-3 per page is suspicious
5. **Check transitions** - "Moreover/Furthermore/Additionally" chains
6. **Evaluate tone** - Excessive formality without criticism

### Editing Workflow

**Step 1: Find High-Alert Words**
```python
from python_docx_redline import Document

doc = Document("draft.docx")

# Search for AI vocabulary
ai_words = [
    "delve", "tapestry", "multifaceted", "pivotal", "realm",
    "landscape", "nuanced", "intricate", "meticulous", "crucial",
    "vital", "embark", "showcasing", "underscores", "vibrant",
    "comprehensive", "cutting-edge", "revolutionary", "testament"
]

for word in ai_words:
    matches = doc.find_all(word)
    if matches:
        print(f"Found '{word}': {len(matches)} occurrences")
        for m in matches:
            print(f"  ...{m.context}...")
```

**Step 2: Find Structural Patterns**
```python
# Find negation patterns
patterns = [
    "not just", "more than just", "goes beyond",
    "isn't just", "isn't merely"
]
for pattern in patterns:
    matches = doc.find_all(pattern)
    if matches:
        print(f"Negation pattern '{pattern}': {len(matches)}")

# Find formulaic transitions
transitions = [
    "Moreover", "Furthermore", "Additionally",
    "In conclusion", "In summary", "In essence"
]
for trans in transitions:
    matches = doc.find_all(trans)
    if matches:
        print(f"Transition '{trans}': {len(matches)}")
```

**Step 3: Batch Replacement**
```python
edits = [
    # Vocabulary fixes
    {"type": "replace", "find": "delve into", "replace": "examine"},
    {"type": "replace", "find": "multifaceted", "replace": "complex"},
    {"type": "replace", "find": "utilize", "replace": "use"},
    {"type": "replace", "find": "leverage", "replace": "use"},

    # Transition fixes
    {"type": "replace", "find": "Moreover, ", "replace": ""},
    {"type": "replace", "find": "Furthermore, ", "replace": ""},
    {"type": "replace", "find": "Additionally, ", "replace": "Also, "},

    # Puffery removal
    {"type": "delete", "text": "It's important to note that "},
    {"type": "delete", "text": "It is worth mentioning that "},
]

doc.apply_edits(edits, occurrence="all")
doc.save("cleaned.docx")
```

### Humanization Checklist

- [ ] No Tier 1 vocabulary (delve, tapestry, multifaceted, pivotal, realm, landscape)
- [ ] Tier 2 vocabulary used sparingly (max 1-2 instances)
- [ ] No formulaic openings ("In today's world...", "When it comes to...")
- [ ] No formulaic closings ("In conclusion...", "In summary...")
- [ ] No "Moreover/Furthermore/Additionally" chains
- [ ] Em dashes used sparingly and purposefully
- [ ] Varied sentence length
- [ ] Direct, specific statements instead of puffery
- [ ] No triplet patterns without purpose
- [ ] No negation structures ("not just X, it's Y")
- [ ] No conversational artifacts ("I hope this helps")
- [ ] Critical perspective where appropriate (not only positive)

### The 30-Second Scan Test

Read the first paragraph of each section. If you encounter:
- Any Tier 1 word: Edit immediately
