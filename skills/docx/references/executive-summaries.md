# Executive Summaries

An executive summary is the most important page of any business document. Many readers will read nothing else.

## What Is an Executive Summary?

A standalone synopsis of the key messages, conclusions, and recommendations in a longer document. It should make sense without reading the full document.

## Rules

### 1. Length: 10% Rule

The executive summary should be approximately 10% of the main document length:

| Document Length | Executive Summary |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| 10 pages | 1 page |
| 20-30 pages | 2 pages |
| 50 pages | 3-5 pages |
| 100+ pages | 5-10 pages |

**Never exceed 10%.** If you can't summarize in 10%, you don't understand your own document.

### 2. Write It Last

Even though the executive summary appears first, write it after completing the full document. By then you'll know:
- What truly matters
- What your actual conclusions are
- What the key evidence is

### 3. Lead with the Recommendation

State your main conclusion or recommendation in the first paragraph. Don't build up to it.

**Bad:**
> This report analyzes the competitive landscape, examines market trends, and evaluates three strategic options. After careful consideration of multiple factors...

**Good:**
> We recommend acquiring CompetitorX for $50M. This acquisition will add $20M annual revenue, eliminate our primary competitive threat, and position us as market leader.

### 4. It Must Stand Alone

A reader who reads only the executive summary should:
- Understand the situation
- Know your recommendation
- Grasp the key supporting reasons
- Know what action is needed

They should NOT need to read the full document to make a decision.

### 5. No New Information

Everything in the executive summary must appear somewhere in the full document. The executive summary summarizes—it doesn't introduce.

## Structure

### SCQA Format (Recommended)

```
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

[Situation - 1-2 sentences]
GlobalTech has grown 12% annually for five years and holds 25% market share
in enterprise software.

[Complication - 1-2 sentences]
Three cloud-native competitors have captured 15% of new deals in the past
18 months, and our win rate against them has dropped from 60% to 35%.

[Recommendation - 1-2 sentences]
We recommend a $50M accelerated cloud migration over 18 months to modernize
our platform and restore competitive position.

[Key Supporting Points - bullets]
This recommendation is supported by:
• Market analysis showing cloud-native expected to be 70% of new sales by 2026
• Technical assessment confirming 18-month migration is achievable
• Financial model projecting 3x ROI within three years

[Next Steps - 1-2 sentences]
We request Board approval of the $50M investment at the January meeting.
Implementation team is ready to begin in Q1.
```

### Bullet-Heavy Format

For data-rich documents:

```
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Recommendation
Proceed with European expansion, starting with UK and Germany in Q2.

Key Findings
• Market opportunity: €2B addressable market, growing 15% annually
• Competitive position: Fewer than 20% of target customers served by competitors
• Investment required: €5M over 18 months
• Expected return: 3x ROI by Year 3

Risks and Mitigants
• Regulatory complexity — Mitigated by existing EU compliance framework
• Currency exposure — Hedging strategy in place
• Talent availability — Partnership with local recruiting firm secured

Investment Required
• €3M capital expenditure (office, infrastructure)
• €2M operating expense (team, marketing)

Next Steps
Request approval for €5M budget at February Board meeting.
```

### Narrative Format

For qualitative recommendations:

```
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

We recommend that TechCo acquire CloudStart for $25M. This acquisition
solves our cloud platform gap, neutralizes our most aggressive competitor,
and provides a proven team we've struggled to recruit organically.

CloudStart's product fills the exact capability gap identified in our
2024 product strategy review. Their 200 enterprise customers include 15
that overlap with our target account list. Integration risk is low because
their architecture was designed for white-label deployment.

The $25M valuation represents 5x ARR, in line with comparable transactions.
Our diligence identified no material issues. Retention agreements are in
place with the CEO and CTO.

We request approval to submit a Letter of Intent by January 31. The
target's shareholders have indicated they will begin a formal sale process
in February if we do not move forward.
```

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Building Up to the Conclusion

**Bad:**
> In order to fully evaluate this opportunity, we first analyzed the market
> landscape, then examined competitive dynamics, and subsequently evaluated
> the financial implications. Based on this comprehensive analysis...

**Good:**
> We recommend moving forward with the acquisition. Here's why...

### Mistake 2: Too Much Detail

**Bad:**
> Revenue grew 12.3% from $456.2M to $512.4M, with Q1 at $121.3M (up 11.2%),
> Q2 at $128.7M (up 13.1%), Q3 at $131.2M (up 12.8%), and Q4 at $131.2M
> (up 12.4%). EBITDA margins improved from 18.2% to 19.7%, driven by
> operating leverage and procurement savings of $2.3M...

**Good:**
> Revenue grew 12% to $512M, with EBITDA margins improving 150bps to 19.7%.
> Detailed financials are in Section 4.

### Mistake 3: Generic Opening

**Bad:**
> This document provides an analysis of the current situation and recommendations
> for future action. The following sections contain detailed information...

**Good:**
> We should exit the Consumer segment by Q3. Despite turnaround efforts,
> the segment lost $15M in 2024 and shows no path to profitability.

### Mistake 4: Missing the "So What"

**Bad:**
> The market is growing at 15% annually. Competitor A launched a new product.
> Our NPS score improved to 45. We hired 50 new employees.

**Good:**
> The market is growing at 15%, faster than we're growing (10%), meaning we're
> losing share. Competitor A's new product directly threatens our core segment.
> We need to accelerate our product roadmap to respond.

### Mistake 5: Hedging Everything

**Bad:**
> We might consider potentially exploring the option of a possible expansion,
> subject to further analysis and favorable market conditions...

**Good:**
> We recommend expanding to Europe. The business case is strong, and the
> risks are manageable.

## Examples by Industry

### Consulting

> **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
>
> GlobalRetail should close 200 underperforming stores over 18 months,
> reducing the footprint by 25% while reinvesting savings in digital
> capabilities.
>
> The retail industry is shifting to digital faster than projected. Our
> store portfolio analysis shows 200 locations destroying value, with
> no realistic path to profitability. Meanwhile, digital sales are
> growing 40% annually but constrained by underinvestment.
>
> Closing these stores will generate $150M in annual savings and free up
> $200M in real estate value. Reinvesting 50% in digital infrastructure
> will accelerate online growth to 60% annually.
>
> We recommend Board approval of the restructuring plan at the March
> meeting. The full implementation plan is detailed in Section 5.

### Investment Banking

> The proposed transaction likely triggers HSR filing requirements, and
> we recommend filing prior to signing the definitive agreement.

> Under current thresholds, transactions valued above $119.5M require
> pre-merger notification. The proposed $150M acquisition clearly exceeds
> this threshold. No exemption appears applicable.
>
> We recommend (1) filing within 5 business days of signing the LOI,
> (2) allocating 45-60 days for regulatory review in the transaction
> timeline, and (3) including a standard HSR condition in the definitive
> agreement.
>
> Detailed analysis of the HSR requirements and potential Second Request
> risk factors follows in the Discussion section.
