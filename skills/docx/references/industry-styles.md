### Structure Principles

**Lead with the answer.** Consulting documents use the Pyramid Principle:
1. State your recommendation/conclusion first
2. Then provide the supporting arguments
3. Then the supporting evidence

**MECE organization.** Content organized in Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive categories.

**Ghost structure first.** Write all section headings before content to ensure logical flow.

### Required Elements

**Executive Summary:**
- Appears on first pages
- States conclusion/recommendation immediately
- Covers Situation → Complication → Resolution (SCR)
- Can be read standalone

**Source Citations:**
```
Source: Industry reports, company filings, consultant analysis
```

**Appendix:**
- All supporting data that doesn't fit the main narrative
- Backup slides for Q&A
- Detailed methodology

**Status Indicators (if draft):**
```
[DRAFT - FOR DISCUSSION]
[PRELIMINARY - SUBJECT TO CHANGE]
```

### Consulting-Specific Rules

1. **Pyramid structure** - Lead with recommendation, support below
2. **MECE content** - No overlaps, no gaps
3. **Action-oriented headings** - "Revenue will grow 15%" not "Revenue Analysis"
4. **Minimal jargon** - Write for client executives, not consultants
5. **Every page earns its place** - If it doesn't support the answer, cut it

### Example Structure

```
1. Executive Summary (1-2 pages)
   - Recommendation
   - Key supporting points
   - Next steps

2. Situation Analysis (5-10 pages)
