# Action Headings Guide

Action headings are the single most impactful improvement you can make to any business document. They transform sections from passive placeholders into persuasive arguments.

## What Is an Action Heading?

An action heading states the **insight or conclusion**, not the topic. It tells the reader what the section means, not just what it's about.

| Topic Heading (Weak) | Action Heading (Strong) |
|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Market Analysis | Market growing 15% annually, driven by cloud adoption |
| Financial Results | Q3 revenue beat targets by 12% on enterprise strength |
| Competitive Landscape | Three competitors control 70% of market—consolidation accelerating |
| Risk Assessment | Integration risk manageable with dedicated PMO |
| Recommendation | Proceed with acquisition at proposed $50M valuation |

## Rules

### 1. Maximum 15 Words

Must fit on one or two lines in standard formatting. Shorter is better.

**Too long:**
> An analysis of our historical performance over the last five fiscal years demonstrates that our company has consistently outperformed industry benchmarks

**Right length:**
> Company outperformed industry benchmarks for five consecutive years

### 2. Complete Thought

Must be understandable without reading the section body.

**Incomplete:**
> Market Position

**Complete:**
> Market position weakening as cloud-native competitors gain share

### 3. Quantify When Possible

Include specific numbers, percentages, or timeframes.

**Vague:**
> Revenue growth was strong

**Specific:**
> Revenue grew 23% to $145M, exceeding plan by 5 points

### 4. Active Voice

Subject → Verb → Object. Avoid passive constructions.

**Passive:**
> Revenue growth was driven by enterprise segment performance

**Active:**
> Enterprise segment drove 23% revenue growth

### 5. Insight, Not Summary

Tell them what it means, not what you did.

**Summary:**
> We analyzed the competitive landscape

**Insight:**
> Competitive landscape favors consolidation—act now or face higher prices

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Topic Labels with Colons

**Bad:**
> Market Analysis: Current State

**Good:**
> Market shrinking 3% annually as customers shift to alternatives

### Mistake 2: Summarizing the Analysis Instead of Stating Findings

**Bad:**
> We interviewed 50 customers to understand their needs

**Good:**
> Customers cite "ease of integration" as top purchase driver

### Mistake 3: Being Vague

**Bad:**
> Costs can be reduced through operational improvements

**Good:**
> Operational improvements can reduce costs by $8M annually

### Mistake 4: Using Passive Voice

**Bad:**
> Revenues were increased by the new product launch

**Good:**
> New product launch increased revenues 25%

### Mistake 5: Hedging

**Bad:**
> It appears that there may be potential opportunities for improvement

**Good:**
> Three opportunities will generate $10M in savings

### Mistake 6: Generic Section Names

**Bad:**
> Overview | Background | Discussion | Conclusion

**Good:**
> Situation requires action | Three factors drove the change | Each option has trade-offs | Recommend Option B

## The Storyline Test

Write all your section headings in a list. Read them in sequence. If someone reading only the headings understands your complete argument, you've succeeded.

**Example — Strategy Recommendation:**

```
1. European market opportunity exceeds $500M annually
2. We're positioned to win with existing product and partnerships
3. Competition is fragmented—no clear leader in target segments
4. Entry risk is manageable with phased approach
5. $25M investment yields 4x return over three years
6. Recommend Board approval for Q2 market entry
```

Reading just these headings tells the entire story: big opportunity → we can win → competition is weak → risk is manageable → good ROI → approval needed.

**Example — M&A Analysis:**

```
1. Target fills critical product gap in our portfolio
2. $50M valuation is fair based on comparable transactions
3. Integration risk is low due to cultural and technical fit
4. Retention agreements secured for key executives
5. Two issues require resolution before signing
6. Recommend LOI submission by month end
```

## Formatting

### Formatting Hierarchy

   Supporting point or subsection insight

       1.1.1 Third-Level Heading: 11-12pt Bold or Italic
       Detail or sub-point
```

## Exercises

Transform these topic headings into action headings:

**1. "Customer Satisfaction Survey Results"**

Think: What did you learn? What should the reader conclude?

Possible: "Customer satisfaction declined 8 points—product quality cited as top concern"

**2. "Quarterly Sales Performance"**

Think: Did you beat targets? By how much? What drove it?

Possible: "Q3 sales exceeded target by 15%, led by enterprise segment growth"

**3. "Competitive Analysis"**

Think: Who's winning? What's changing? What should we do?

Possible: "Competitor X gaining share rapidly—respond within 6 months or cede market"

**4. "Technology Stack Assessment"**

Think: Is it good or bad? What's the implication?

Possible: "Legacy technology limits growth—modernization investment required"

**5. "Project Status Update"**

Think: On track or not? What's the key message?

Possible: "Project on track for Q2 delivery, but resource constraint threatens Q3 phase"

## Quick Reference

### Checklist for Every Heading

- [ ] States an insight or conclusion, not a topic
- [ ] Could be understood without reading the section
- [ ] Uses active voice
- [ ] Includes specifics (numbers, names, timeframes) where possible
- [ ] Is under 15 words
- [ ] Matches the level of other headings at same level

### The "So What?" Test

After writing each heading, ask: "So what?"

If the heading doesn't answer that question, rewrite it.

**Topic heading:** "Revenue Performance"
**So what?** Revenue was up/down/flat? Beat/missed targets?
**Action heading:** "Revenue up 12%, beating plan for third consecutive quarter"
