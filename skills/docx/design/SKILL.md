# Document Design

Create professional, persuasive documents that drive decisions. This skill combines design intelligence from elite business contexts (consulting, banking, legal) with practical writing guidance.

## Before Writing Any Document

Understand the context:

- **Purpose**: What decision or action should this document drive?
- **Audience**: Who are they? What do they need? How much time do they have?
- **Key Message**: If the reader remembers only ONE thing, what must it be?
- **Tone**: Match the context — analytical (consulting), precise (legal), data-driven (banking)

## The Non-Negotiables

### 1. Lead with the Answer

State your conclusion or recommendation in the first paragraph and the first sentence of each section. Don't make executives hunt for your point.

### 2. Action Headings

Every section heading states the **takeaway**, not the topic.

| Topic Heading (Weak) | Action Heading (Strong) |
|----------------------|-------------------------|
| "Q3 Results" | "Q3 revenue beat targets by 12%, driven by enterprise" |
| "Market Analysis" | "Market consolidating—three players now control 70%" |

See [action-headings.md](./action-headings.md) for details.

### 3. Pyramid Structure

Organize content in a pyramid: main point at top, supporting arguments below, evidence below that.

See [document-structure.md](./document-structure.md) for frameworks (Pyramid Principle, SCQA, IRAC).

### 4. Professional Formatting

Typography, spacing, and layout signal credibility before anyone reads a word.

See [design-principles.md](./design-principles.md) for guidelines.

## Document Anti-Patterns

**NEVER** produce generic documents. Avoid:

- **Topic headings**: "Background", "Analysis" — say nothing. Use action headings
- **Burying the lead**: Recommendation on page 20 means failure. Lead with conclusions
- **Wall of text**: No headings, no structure, no scanability
- **Hedge-everything language**: "We might consider potentially..." — take a position
- **Inconsistent formatting**: Mixed fonts, random spacing signals carelessness
- **AI writing tells**: Words like "delve," "tapestry," "multifaceted"; patterns like "It's not X, it's Y"

See [ai-antipatterns.md](./ai-antipatterns.md) for comprehensive AI writing tells to avoid.

Remember: The goal isn't a "good enough" document—it's one that drives decisions.
